# Hi, I'm Omair Tariq Khan!


# About Me
I graduated in May 2023 from Rutgers University in New Jersey with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am a Product Development Engineer for Intel Corporation, collaborating closely with our team to innovate and deliver quality software solutions that meet our customers' needs. Though my background is in ECE, I am passionate about learning new skills and technologies and improving the software development processes. Here, you can follow my journey from hardware engineering to software development. I am a collaborative person with effective communication and a strong work ethic.

To further my interest in software development, I'll be starting my Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in January 2025, focusing on expanding my knowledge in computing systems and machine learning.
